In this R code file "StatResearchProject.r", I calculate the Kurtosis scores with 95% CI for 3 neuroscience studies. The Kurtosis scores are based on each study's respective dependent and independent variables. Group n's and variance ratios between treatment and control groups are also calculated. At the very end, a forest plot is made to visualize the Kurtosis score and CI. This is an ongoing project, so more studies will be added to the script.
